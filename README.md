### Instructions
Assume you're creating an app that allows the user to 
post status updates (ala Twitter). Your UI should have a
textarea and a button. The button should be disabled if the
length of the textarea is 0 or greater than 240 characters.
The document's title should inform the user on how many
characters they have left to type before they hit the 240
character limit - "115 characters left."
